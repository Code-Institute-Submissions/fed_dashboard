This programme creates an interactive Frontend Development Website in the form of a Dashboard. It incorporates html, css and javascript mainly in the form of 
libraries. Jasmine is also used to do some tests on javascript used. The dashboard is visualised using d3.js and dc.js incorporating crossfilter. The dataset
chosen is published by the Department of Education and Skills and sourced from https://data.gov.ie/dataset. It is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 
4.0. The data was downloaded in csv format and converted into a json format for use in a data folder.The json format was authenticated using a json validator 
and formatter tool located at https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/. The data consists of information relating to achievement in the secondary school 
level final examination in the Republic of Ireland across both genders over a 17 year period. The data chosen is useful in representing achievement of grades 
(by predetermined criteria) in both genders and over a period of time.
Analysis of the dataset revealed, that while limited in the range of data contained, it would lend itself well to a comparison on achievement of results
among the genders. Pencil wireframe was used to plot 2 dimensional frames of the various sections of the dashboard. It was decided to use a mixture of pie 
charts, composite line charts and stacked chart to populate the dashboard and represent the data. Pie charts were useful in representing the relative contribution
(proportion) of the genders, in relation to the overall pupil tota, with respect to attendance and achievements. Line charts were useful in representing trends
on an annual basis. A scatter plot was useful in illustrating the linear relationship for attendance. A stacked bar chart was used to represent parts of a 
whole in relation to achievement of the various categories of results among the genders.
